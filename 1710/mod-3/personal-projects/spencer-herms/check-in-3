## Project Name: Blend

#### Check In: 3

#### Progress made?

Test suite has been expanded to 20 tests.
 
Fetching all data from api and cleaning the data.  All data is rendering as cards in the main container and basic styling is complete.  

Complete-me has been imported.  Suggestions are being made and shown to the user in a drop down.  Suggestions are going to an array in the state of MainForm.  Going to compare this array all the data and then filter the rendered cards based on what is in the suggestion array.

Error handling is improved and an error screen is now rendered when an error occurs. 


#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

Have filtering based on search field however the search suggestions are not being rendered as cards.

#### Next Steps?

Write more test to be at full coverage for every function / method.

Get suggestions to render as cards.  

Make a get pairings button for each card.

Start to make a selected button where multiple cards can eventually be compared for pairings.


#### What are your concerns (if any)

Is it ok to be requesting so many images at one time from the server? 

Sometimes my descriptions come back as null but this does not happen in Postman only in my app.  

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
