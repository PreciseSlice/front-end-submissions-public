## Project Name: Blend 

#### Check In: 4

#### Progress made?

Input field now filters and renders the cards in real time. 

Many tests have been added.

Clicked cards are now going to the pairing array.

The routes are set up for the pairing page, working on rendering. 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

One the pairing array is rendering I need to make a button to click to get pairing for all ingredients in the array.

Need to make a button on the card that gets pairing for the individual item.  Could be accessed on the main page.

#### Next Steps?

Get the pairing cards rendering.  

Refactor the array the pairing cards are being stored in.  Selected should be a boolean and then filter the array.

Make the button for pairing on all cards.

Style, crush little bugs, get testing to full coverage. 
 

#### What are your concerns (if any)

Having some inconsistency with the api.  The value of ‘description’ comes back as ‘null’. Never happens in postman but happens in my app.  Mentor could not solve the issue with me after 30 mins.  Watts looked for a few mins with me as well.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
